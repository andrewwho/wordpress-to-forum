This is a simple javascript tool to convert wordpress posts containing image tag
s (<img src="foobar.jpg"/>) to forum friendly posts ([IMG]http://www.foobar.com/1.jpg[/IMG]).

A few options are available depending which forum format is required (use of [IMG] is optional).  Furthermore, the page will pull all the images out and display
 them in a thumbnail in the case you want to insert captions for each image.  These images are stored locally and erased once the cache is full.
